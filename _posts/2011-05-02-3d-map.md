An arduino-powered, 3d-printed map of Italy to physically represent statistical data (such as GDP, population density..).

Each region is independently controlled by a stepper motor and moves along the z-axis due to an (also 3d-printed) rack mechanism.

The complete documentation, along with the code and STL files will (hopefully) be online soon!
