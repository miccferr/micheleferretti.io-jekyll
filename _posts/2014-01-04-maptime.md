"Maptime is an open learning environment for all levels and degrees of knowledge, offering intentional educational support for the beginner. Maptime is simultaneously flexible and structured, creating space for mapping tutorials, workshops, ongoing projects with a shared goal, and independent/collaborative work time.. (from :[maptime.io/about](http://maptime.io/about/))

In December 2014 I started the [Milanese chapter](https://twitter.com/MaptimeMI) in the amazing FabLab [Opendot](opendotlab.it). Since then, we had the most fun and interesting nights, learning together web-mapping tools such as [LeafletJS](leafletjs.com) and [Mapbox Studio](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio/#darwin).

But this is just the beginning! In the next few months we'll have various guest such as data journalist and designers, to teach us the best practices of storytelling and data visualization.
As always...*Beginners most welcome!*
