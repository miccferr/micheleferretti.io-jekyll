ACHILLES:



Demo awarded 2nd Place at the DataSpark Mobility Challenge organized by
the International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management
(CIKM) - Singapore, Nov. 2017

Background: The availability of massive datasets describing human
mobility offer the possibility to monitor and improve the resilience of
transportation systems to traumatic events such as disasters of natural
or anthropocentric origin. In this perspective, we propose a visual,
data-driven and network-based simulation tool based on a multiplex
network representation of mobility data, where every layer describes
movement of people's with a given trans- portation mode. We then develop
a visual analytics tool which provides an easy-to-use interface to
explore the mobility uxes and the connectivity of every urban zone in a
city. Our visual analytics tool allows the user to visualize changes in
the transportation system resulting from the addition or removal of
transportation modes, urban zones and single stops. We show how our
visual system can be used to explore mobility in Singapore, by using
data provided by the CIKM challenge 2017 and Singapore mobility data
obtained from external sources. e system allows to simulate the reaction
to changes in the Singapore's public trans- portation system, such as
closing/adding transportation modes or subway/bus stops.
