In the spring of 2013 I had the opportunity to attend a course on "Multivariate Statistics" at the Faculty of [Mathematics Engineering](https://mox.polimi.it/), Politecnico di Milano. During the entire semester I worked on a project with a group of engineers, using the absolute volume of traffic (in Erlang) from mobile phone data, to model people's presence and movement within Milan's first urban belt, and derive a land-use classification based entirely on such data.
