## Hi there!

My name is Michele.

I'm currently pursuing a PhD at the [Department of Geography, King's College London](http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/geography/index.aspx). There, I'm affiliated with the _Geocomputation_ and the _Urban Futures_ research domains.

I'm passionate about (open)geospatial technologies and their applications to urban environments.

If you want to get in touch just send me an e-mail directly to: [michele.ferretti@kcl.ac.uk](mailto:michele.ferretti@kcl.ac.uk)
